**ft_printf**

The ft_printf project is designed to create your own version of the printf function in C. It involves handling various format specifiers like %d, %s, %x, etc., and formatting the output properly. The main objectives include understanding how to process variable arguments, managing different data types, and implementing custom formatting for different types of data. This project allows you to practice handling memory, argument lists, and building flexible and efficient output functions from scratch.
